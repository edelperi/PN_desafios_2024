Summary

The preceding projects, BIOINPUT-CGL2016-78660-R and BIOLLETS-PID2019-111253RB-I00, culminated in the development of a pre-emergence ecoherbicide. This ecoherbicide, based on mixtures of densified allelopathic biomass, is suitable for Integrated Weed Management (IWM). Within the scope of BIOLLETS, the phytotoxic effects of a formulation and its performance in controlling a selection of weeds in a singular soil and cropping system were ascertained. Consequently, the necessity has emerged to validate its activity and behaviour across various soil types, climates, weed communities, and cropping systems. This has led to the proposal of a new four-year project with two specific objectives (O):

O1: The examination of the transport of active substances released by the ecoherbicide in five representative soils of the Iberian Peninsula, each with distinct mineralogy, texture, acidity, and percentage of organic matter (OM%).

O2: (a) The validation of the ecoherbicideâ€™s effectiveness in five primary cropping systems on these soils, inclusive of herbicide-resistant weeds; and (b) the evaluation of potential adverse effects on crops, beneficial flora, and soil microorganisms following successive applications.

The diagrams included in the PowerPoint file illustrate the experimental procedure to determine the following:

a) The partition equilibria of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and phenols from the allelopathic bio-herbicide to the selected representative soils using the EPIC procedure.

b) The setup of transport experiments in soil columns to determine the advective convective transport in soil and diffusion.

c) The execution of transport experiments in soil columns.

d) The transient diffusion experiments in columns used as diffusion cells.

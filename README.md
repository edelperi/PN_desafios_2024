Summary

Previous projects (BIOINPUT-CGL2016-78660-R, BIOLLETS-PID2019-111253RB-I00) led to the invention of a pre-emergence ecoherbicide based on mixtures of densified allelopathic biomass suitable for integrated weed management (IWM). In BIOLLETS, a formulation's phytotoxic effects and performance to control a selection of weeds in a single soil and cropping system were determined. The need then arises to validate its activity and behaviour in other soil types, climates, weed communities and cropping systems, proposing here a new four-year project with two specific objectives (O):

O1. To examine the transport of active substances released by the ecoherbicide in five representative soils of the Iberian Peninsula with characteristic mineralogy, texture, acidity, and percentage of organic matter (OM%).
O2. (a) To validate the effectiveness of the ecoherbicide in five main cropping systems on these soils, including herbicide-resistant weeds; and (b) to evaluate, after successive applications, the potential adverse effects on crops, beneficial flora, and soil micro-organisms.

The schemes drawn in the powepoint file ilustrate the experimental procedure do determine the:
  a) Partition equilibria of VOCs and phenols from the allelopatic bio-herbicide to the representative selected soils using the EPIC procedude.
  b) Setup of transport experiments in soil columns do determina de advetive convective trasnport in soil and diffusion.
  c) Transport experiments in soil columns
  d) Transient diffusion experimens sin columns used as diffusion cells.
